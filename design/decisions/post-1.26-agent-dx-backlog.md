# Post-1.26 agent-DX backlog (P40-P44 intent)

- Status: planning (intent record, not an implementation RFC)
- Date: 2026-05-30
- Related: [Root-cause-first completion errors](root-cause-completion-errors-rfc.md) (P39, accepted)

## What this is

A sequencing record for the agent-facing DX work that follows P39. It captures
intent only — each phase below ships with its **own** accepted RFC authored at
its turn, not from this file. The source is the 1.26.0 real-use feedback (an AI
agent driving `task complete` on `requires_decision` tasks) plus a proposed
external roadmap. The headline finding the feedback **proved**: an ADR's
pre-commitments propagated into the downstream implementation/tests (P2-T1 →
P2-T2). That is code-pact's demonstrated differentiator, and it shapes the order.

The theme across all of these is the same as P39: **do not add value the agent
can't find — make the control surface carry it.** Several of the proposed
phases, taken literally, would *widen* the contract (a third "what next"
structure, a self-referential version file). Where that risk exists it is called
out below as a re-scope to settle in the phase's RFC.

## Sequence (differentiation-first)

~~P39~~ → ~~P43~~ → ~~P41~~ → **P40 → P42 → P44** (P39, P43, and P41 shipped;
remaining sequence is P40 → P42 → P44). Rationale: after P39 closed the largest
current pain, we led with the one capability the feedback empirically validated
(P43 — shipped), banked the cheap trust fill (P41 — shipped), and next take the
contract-shape decisions (P40, P42) deliberately. A pain-first ordering (P40
before P43) was considered and rejected: P40 is a contract-shape change that
needs its own ADR and carries a real bloat risk, whereas P43 strengthened a
proven win.

## P43 — ADR downstream commitments — **shipped**

- **Outcome.** Shipped as `design/phases/P43-adr-downstream-commitments.yaml`
  (RFC: `design/decisions/adr-downstream-commitments-rfc.md`). An ADR may carry a
  `## Implementation commitments` checkbox list. `task prepare` surfaces the
  parsed commitments of the **accepted ADRs the decision resolver considered** as
  an additive `decision_commitments` field (advisory context, not gate
  enforcement — an unresolved explicit `decision_refs` gate may still surface its
  accepted refs). `plan lint --include-quality` emits `ADR_COMMITMENTS_EMPTY`
  (`affects_exit: false`) only for an accepted ADR that **resolves** a
  `requires_decision` task's gate and records no implementation commitments.
- **Also shipped:** `PHASE_DOCS_WRITE_NO_DOC_CHECK` — a forward-looking
  docs-drift guard (a not-`done` phase that writes public docs but runs no doc
  check in its verification), generalizing the P39/P43 docs-drift lesson.
- **Fit with the enforcement philosophy:** deterministic surfacing, advisory
  only, never an LLM free-summary (explicitly rejected). Resolved open questions:
  commitment syntax is a checkbox list under the fixed `## Implementation
  commitments` heading; `task context` does **not** echo commitments (prepare-only).
- **Follow-on sequence:** remaining backlog is P40 → P42 → P44 (P41 has since shipped).

## P41 — leaf help + docs straightening — **shipped**

- **Outcome.** Shipped as `design/phases/P41-leaf-help-docs-straightening.yaml`
  (RFC: `design/decisions/leaf-help-docs-straightening-rfc.md`). The 7 stubbed
  task lifecycle verbs (`add`, `context`, `start`, `status`, `block`, `resume`,
  `runbook`) now have rich leaf `--help`, pinned by a unit suite
  (`task-lifecycle-help-terms.test.ts`, all 11 rich task verbs) and the
  integration `cli-help` table. The `record_only` lifecycle explanation is
  consolidated to its canonical home `docs/per-task-loop.md`; `cli-contract.md`
  and `agent-contract.md` link out for the concept while keeping their
  role-specific contract/agent facts. No new docs page; aliases (`next`/
  `reconcile`) intentionally stay stubs (a later task).
- **Scope held:** `--help` parity was limited to the 7 task verbs (plan/phase/
  adapter stubs deferred); docs were reduced (duplication removed), not grown.

## P40 — task prepare lifecycle-aware (contract decision)

- **Verified premise.** `task prepare`'s `commands` dict is built once and is
  identical regardless of `recommendation.lifecycleMode`; `next_action.message`
  is static per task-state, not mode-aware. So the gap is real.
- **Re-scope (settle in RFC).** The proposed fix adds a NEW `recommended_flow`
  structure. That would be a **third** "what next" representation alongside the
  existing `commands` and `next_action` — ambiguous (which is authoritative?)
  and contrary to "small surfaces, clear contracts", i.e. it works against the
  very goal of not making the agent guess. Prefer making the **existing**
  surfaces mode-aware: filter/order `commands` by `lifecycleMode` and reflect
  the mode in `next_action.message`. If a `recommended_flow` is still wanted,
  `next_action` must be derived from it (one source of truth), not added beside
  it. This is a contract-shape decision → author as a `decision_loop` phase.

## P42 — project-side version pinning (re-scope to docs-first)

- **Re-scope (settle in RFC).** The feedback itself says this is the
  *consumer's* responsibility (pin the `devDependency`; stop following
  `npx code-pact@latest`). A `.code-pact/code-pact.version` file + a
  `CODE_PACT_VERSION_MISMATCH` diagnostic is self-referential: it cannot
  guarantee the *running* CLI matches, and it drifts silently in exactly the
  case it is meant to catch (an unpinned consumer). Lead with docs — drop
  `npx @latest` as the default recommendation, document `devDependency` pin + CI
  using the pinned binary — and consider only a lightweight `validate` advisory.
  The full `.version` mechanism is lower priority and may not be built.

## P44 — CI / adoption kit (docs + template, last)

- **Goal.** Lower adoption friction: a `docs/` CI page (the `validate --strict`
  / `doctor --base-ref` / `plan lint --strict` sequence) and a GitHub Actions
  template. The detectors it documents (`CONTROL_PLANE_*`, branch-drift) already
  exist (P33/P34), so this is purely docs + template.
- **Constraints.** No external-tool name-drops in public docs; English-primary +
  `docs/ja` mirror.

## Non-goals (this backlog)

- It does not authorize implementing P40-P44 now. P39 is the only phase
  registered in `design/roadmap.yaml`; each of P40-P44 is registered with its own
  accepted RFC when its turn comes.
- It does not lock the re-scopes above; they are the recommended starting
  position for each phase's RFC, to be confirmed or overridden there.
