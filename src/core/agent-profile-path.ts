// Single source of truth for where an agent's profile lives.
//
// `doctor` resolves the profile via the project's `agents[].profile` (a
// schema-validated project-relative path), but every other command
// hardcodes `agent-profiles/<name>.yaml`. For a project whose `agents[].profile`
// is non-default, that made doctor point at one file while `adapter upgrade`
// (and recommend / task prepare / pack / the model_version pin) read another.
// These helpers make all of them agree with doctor.
//
// Resolution honors `project.yaml`'s matching `agents[].profile`, falling back
// to the conventional `agent-profiles/<name>.yaml` (what `init` writes) ONLY
// when project.yaml is absent or the agent is not listed. A present-but-broken
// config — unparseable project.yaml, or a matched agent whose `profile` is an
// invalid path — fails with CONFIG_ERROR rather than being masked behind the
// default. (An unrelated invalid field elsewhere does not block resolution: we
// read just the matched agent's `profile`.)

 *
 * Falls back to the convention only when project.yaml is absent (ENOENT) or the
 * agent is not listed in a valid `agents` array. A present-but-broken config —
 * unreadable or unparseable project.yaml, a missing / non-array `agents`, or a
 * matched agent whose `profile` is an *invalid* path (e.g. `../../etc/x`) —
 * throws `CONFIG_ERROR` rather than falling back: the project exists and (for
 * the profile case) explicitly declared that path, so silently reading/writing
 * a different file would hide the misconfiguration. The resolved path is
 * validated (`RelativePosixPath`: no `..`, no absolute, no backslash) before use.
